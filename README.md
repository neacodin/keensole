# Keensole
[![Browser Support Status](https://badges.herokuapp.com/browsers?googlechrome=%5E27&firefox=%5E31&iexplore=%5E9)](https://badges.herokuapp.com/browsers?googlechrome=%5E27&firefox=%5E31&iexplore=%5E9)

It does a very simple thing, extends `console.log` functionality in a funny way. It adds a few helper functions to make your message interesting!

## Let's see how

It follows a very simple instruction. Just chain as many functions as you need to get to your desire output. For instance if I want to show there is something wrong in a piece of code I will follow below command.

```javascript
keensole.error().log('Oops, something went wrong!');
```

Or in case of showing a successful message in upper case, following command is a choice.

```javascript
keensole.success().upper().log('Great, it works like a charm!');
```

You see, you should start with `keensole` and end with `log` with a message as the parameter passed to it. Between these, you are free to use as many helper function as required.

For a list of available functions see [the table below]()

## Contributing

We really appreciate any contributation to make it more useful. As a collaborator once you clone the repository you need to run `npm install` to install required development dependencies.

Since we are using EcmaScript 6 (the great ES6üòç), we use `babel` to translate it to ES5. So you need to run a very simple gulp task called `build` each time you change the source and you want to see your changes. Just run `gulp build`.
